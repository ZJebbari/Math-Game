The math game Android app is an engaging and addictive game that challenges your arithmetic skills. At the start of the game, the player selects the operation they want to practice: addition, subtraction, or multiplication. Then, the game displays two random numbers on the screen, and the player must calculate the correct answer based on the selected operation.

For each correct answer, the player earns 10 points towards their score. However, the player must be careful, as they only have three lives. If they make three mistakes or run out of time, the game is over, and the final score is displayed.

The app employs Java code to handle the arithmetic calculations and track the player's progress, with advanced algorithms that ensure a varied and challenging gameplay experience.

The app provides a user-friendly interface with simple controls, making it easy for players of all ages to enjoy. It includes built-in features like a timer and a scoring system, allowing players to track their progress and compete against themselves or others.
